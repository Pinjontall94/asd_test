What follows is the order of operations in this pipeline, from a raw pdf of a
metagenomics study (with a relevant SRA accession number) to the merged,
concatenated, and screened fasta 

Note: This pipeline currently only works on 16S V4 sequences (though support
for arbitrary sequences is a high priority going forward!)

--------------------------
-- Order of operations: --
--------------------------

Extract relevant SRA # from study PDF's

Search online for SRA run table and metadata

Use fastq-dump from SRA-toolkit to download the fastqs

Filter fastqs to isolate the 16S V4 sequences

Merge forward and reverse fastqs

Convert fastqs to fastas with bbtools "reformat"

Make group file for mothur

Remove primers with cutadapt

Screen for PhiX (as needed)

Concatenate fastas 

Make summary with mothur for combined fasta file

Screen Sequences with mothur

Split Groups

Relabel fasta headers for compatibility with vsearch

Re-concatenate the barcoded fastas

- Now that I'm thinking of it, though, it may make more sense to have the PDF 
	converting part of this be a separate function...may still make sense 
	as a single GUI app, though

- Modify asdMetagen to delete all files EXCEPT:
	* original fastq's (including filtered, presumably)
	* immediate pre- and post-summary fastas
	* final barcoded fasta
	* all ".good.*" group and fasta files
	* phix_db/
	* SraRunTable.txt & SRR_Acc_List.txt

- Ergo, delete all files after they're DEFINITELY not needed
	* So, maybe a final cleanup function?
	* Could add an optional flag to bypass it (-k for "keep"?)

mkdir keep temp
mv *.fastq *.
