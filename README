What follows is the order of operations in this pipeline, from a raw pdf of a
metagenomics study (with a relevant SRA accession number) to the merged,
concatenated, and screened fasta 

Note: This pipeline currently only works on 16S V4 sequences (though support
for arbitrary sequences is a high priority going forward!)

--------------------------
-- Order of operations: --
--------------------------

1. Extract relevant SRA # from study PDF's
	-- function: sraFinder

2. Search online for SRA run table and metadata
	-- function: TBD
	-- [WORKAROUND]: type "!ncbi SRA<result from pdfshot.sh>" into DuckDuckGo

3. Use fastq-dump from SRA-toolkit to download the fastqs
	-- function: srr_munch

4. Filter fastqs to isolate the 16S V4 sequences
	-- function: 16S_extractor

5. Merge forward and reverse fastqs
	-- function: flash2_merge

6. Convert fastqs to fastas with bbtools "reformat"
	-- function: q2a_reformat

7. Remove primers with cutadapt
	-- function: primer_trim [VERIFY]

8. Screen for PhiX (as needed)
	-- function: phix
	-- (Relevant Info): ASD_metaanal_screening_fasta.txt

9. Concatenate fastas 
	-- function: groupConcat [VERIFY]

10. Make group file for mothur
	-- function: groupFormatter

11. Make summary with mothur for combined fasta file
	-- function: ./mothur TBD
	-- (Relevant Info): ASD_metaanal_screening_fasta.txt

12. Screen Sequences with mothur
	-- function: ./mothur screening_batch.txt
	-- (Relevant Info): ASD_metaanal_screening_fasta.txt
